        Robert Greene (born May 14, 1959) is an American author of books on strategy, power, and seduction. 
        He has written seven international bestsellers, including The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, 
        The 33 Strategies of War, The 50th Law (with rapper 50 Cent), Mastery, The Laws of Human Nature, and The Daily Laws.

        Born in 1959, Greene studied classical studies and worked a variety of jobs, before publishing his first book in 1998. 
        Greene frequently draws on analyses of past historical figures and events throughout his writing. 
        Greene's works have been referenced by a wide variety of celebrities, political figures, and civil rights activists.

        The younger son of Jewish parents, Greene grew up in Los Angeles and attended the University of California, Berkeley, 
        before finishing his degree at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison with a B.A. degree in classical studies. 
        Prior to becoming an author, Greene estimates that he worked about 50 jobs, including as a construction worker, 
        translator, magazine editor, and Hollywood movie writer. In 1995, Greene worked as a writer at Fabrica, 
        an art and media school in Italy, and met a book packager named Joost Elffers. Greene pitched a book about power to Elffers 
        and wrote a treatment which eventually became The 48 Laws of Power. He would note this as the turning point of his life.
